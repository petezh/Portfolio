This is a small collection of those new to machine learning, reinforcement learning, and the applications to cryptography, compiled for Professor Gasarch at UMD.

## Machine Learning

"Machine Learning is an idea to learn from examples and experience, without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing code, you feed data to the generic algorithm, and it builds logic based on the data given."

Check out [this article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-machine-learning/){target="_blank"} for an overview of the motivations and concepts involved with machine learning.

The following videos will provide a strong mathematical foundation for machine learning. Don't worry, the videos are very accessible.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) is one type of machine learning. The general idea is to train an *agent* to act within an *environment*.

Watch the following introduction to RL.

## Cryptography

There have been many applications of machine learning to cryptography. The focus of this compilation is on cryptanalysis: decrypting and classifying ciphers. Other applications are also collected below.

### Decrypting Ciphers

Many studies have tried to use machine learning to recover the message from encrypted text. Be sure to read this introductory paper - it's the best starting point.

[Focardi and Luccio - Neural Cryptanalysis of Classical Ciphers](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2243/paper10.pdf){target="_blank"}

Other researchers have used a variety of ML techniques to tackle many different types of ciphers.

### Classifying Ciphers

Other researchers have tried classify encrypted messages.

### Miscellaneous

Cool study where Google researchers trained agents to learn how to communicate with keys.
