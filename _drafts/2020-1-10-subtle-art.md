funny, casual read

maybe overdoes the profnity



bukowski example, personal failure, woo women and drive drunk

selfimprovement=/=success

demand to be smart, wealthy, happy is grounded in lack, reinforced by social media

seeing failure as problem manifests in feedback cycles, guilty for guilt, angry abot anger

intervention - not giving a fuck

**The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience.**

not a resignation to failure-acceptance of your shortcomings, e.g. accepting an embracing struggle to write gives me the motivation to stick it through. 



neither is it total emotione=lessness, psychopathy

rule 1

**Subtlety #1: Be difference, not indifferent.**

caring--or-giving a fuck---is inevitable. question fo what to care baout.

whats unimportant---petty cliques, the past, annoyances---and focusing on whatever they decide matters.

that choice is inevitabl---piss of people. time trradeoffs.

**Subtlety 2: Find purpose.**

in the adsents of challenge, peple invent their own problems (for rich white poeple, these are called "first world problems").

learning to divest from a problem is often as simple as picking something

**Subtlety 3: Choose.**

maturity = selective

grandpa plays the radio loudly, smokes, etc. accepted



won't eliminate suffering --- that's not the point. it'll

**happjness**

suffeirng inevitba

conclusion of the bhudda

pain biologuical, including psychological. rejection from girl might teach you something about the way you dress

happiness work in rpogress, comes from solving prblmes

1. denial
2. victim

repessing and overidentifing emotins bith bad. we should take sagging body weight as a reasn to go to the gym, but we shouldnt take the strain of a hard wokrout as a reason to quick



ask not, "what do you enjoy?" but "what pain will yu endure?" the path to wealth, health, and love is paved with long work weeks, strenuous jogs, and bitter quarrels.

succcessful people enjoy that pain. true leasure is int he climb itself'

**you're not special**

self esteem not intrinscially good

correct measurement is how they feel about the parts they know are bad

blind self esteem turns into an exhausting, regressive, narcisstic bubble

"oh everything;s fie" meme, point out

perhaps liberal sensiivities bad

you arent special, and the "everyone is special" mentaity is self contradictory

ibsidious---specialness not key
