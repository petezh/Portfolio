#### Anecdote

My college essay journey was a spectacular, hilarious disaster. Most of my friends started in the summer;  started as early as spring; the feet-draggers started in September.

On the weekend of October 22nd, I visited the library, sat in a corner, and made a Google Doc titled "College Apps." On October 29th, that document was renamed "Final Countdown." By October 31st, I had finished the Common App and started working on Yale's supplementals. On the night of November 1st, I started copy-pasting my responses into the portal.

I'll never forget it. I had written 6 or so pathetic paragraphs, most of them around 50 words. They were shit, but I was fairly impressed with myself. I finished pasting what I thought was the last response and clicked "next." I found a stinky surprise.

Two 250 word prompts. Whose existence was previously unbeknownst to me. I tried—I really did—to craft 10 wpm with the 50 minutes I had left. I was saved by a miracle: my credit card got declined and I couldn't submit them.

If you're wondering about the rest of the essays went, keep in mind that Berkeley is notorious for [not really caring](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/ucs-do-not-read-college-application-essays/1195014) about essays. Thank the Lord!

#### Problem

I am a procrastinator by nature. Writing an article is a month-long affair. My presentations won't get turned in until a day or two before the deadline. Don't even ask how long it took to set up this site.

For years, I was puzzled by my own behavior. The common causes of procrastination didn't provide much insight. The problem definitely isn't organization. I can schedule in (as I did, every week, for months) a time to work on my website, but when time comes, I will concoct some urgent diversion (such as, say, that I suddenly feel a passion for jogging). It also isn't task aversion, a lack of energy, or trouble focusing. Debate cases, grunt work for classes, reading dry books—no problem. I *crave* the dopamine rush that comes from checking off a task. Nor is it a fear of failure. I'm fairly confident that I can succeed at most things if I put in the efforts.

On reflection, I think there are three underlying mechanisms that explain why sometimes I procrastinate, and other times I don't. You might relate to these.

1. **Fear of judgement.** I'm not great at taking criticism. I have a sensitive ego and a dangerous love for arguing. The worst scenario is when I'm doing something that I don't think I'm good at. When I got back reviews for mentoring, I waited a week to open them. Objectively, this was the least intimidating form of judgement: an excel sheet with numbers. But the fact that I was a new mentor and didn't know what scores to expect was frightening.
2. **Diminishing returns.** I convince myself that there's no point to starting now. This sometimes happens with writing [Premier briefs](https://www.premierdebate.com/briefs/). Topic just came out? Busy with schoolwork, I'll start tomorrow. A week in? Still have time, I'll take it slow. A month in? Too late anyways, might as well start later. Whenever there aren't clear deadlines for subtasks, I rationalize away self-imposed due dates.
3. **Perfectionism.** I care about my work, and I want it to reflect my character. Because of that, it's hard for me to in work that's incomplete or has mistakes. It's particularly hard for creative exercises like writing, since the entire point is that there's no "right" way to do it. I can fix the grammar and spelling mistakes, but the wording or tone can always feel off. The worst consequence is the "all or nothing" attitude: if something's not perfect, then it's terrible. There's no in between and there's no point to trying to make it less terrible.

It's the unfamiliar, self-paced, and creative tasks that really screw me. The prospect of having friends review my essays was horrifying. So, each weekend, the "get started" date was booted to the next Saturday. When I eventually started, it hard from me to know when to move on and where to allocate my time; some essays were hopeless, others had to be perfect.

If you've read [Subtle Art](https://peterzhang.info/subtle-art), you'll immediately recognize this as a *feedback cycle from hell*. Procrastinating intensifies criticism, further degrades the benefits of punctuality, and definitely makes it harder to have a perfect product. Oy vey!

#### Solution

This past semester has featured more assignment and projects than I had ever juggled before. In adapting to the new environment, I designed some coping mechanisms. If your problems are the same as mine, then maybe these will help.

1. **Visualize**. Picture the worst case scenarios. What's the *worst* feedback that they could give? If I wait, what is the worst result then? Meditating on this is super helpful. It mitigates the threat of judgement while also clarifying that waiting will make it worse.
2. **Decide for yourself.** It's an idea inspired by the book [Nudge](https://peterzhang.info/decision-making). Give yourself a deadline. No, not just a "mental" deadline or a note on the calendar. Find some way to artificially create an external deadline. An example: When I dread writing an email, I'll have [Streak](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/streak-crm-for-gmail/pnnfemgpilpdaojpnkjdgfgbnnjojfik?hl=en-US) to auto-send the email in an hour. If I slack and don't finish it, some garbled outline will get sent. I do this for posts like this too. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) let's you upload drafts that go live in the future. If the article isn't finished by then, then, well, some embarrassing mess will get posted. 
3. **Move fast, break things.** Not a great motto for a tech conglomerate, but a surprisingly good productivity technique. Answer your messages instantly; do the homework once it comes out; get started on that article idea you just had. I wrote about this in the context of [habits](https://peterzhang.info/2020-review), but it really applies to all kinds of commitments. The best way to dispel work-related premonitions is to get started and show yourself that it's not that bad. Make it a habit and you won't even need to make a conscious decision. It'll solve the perfectionism: if you're thinking about getting everything done, you won't be thinking about getting one thing done "perfectly."

#### Conclusion

A final thought. Don't blame yourself for how you are. Reshaping how you view my work is not an overnight (or over-semester) change and I definitely continue to struggle. Your innate instincts and rationalizations might never go away, but accepting that they exist and trying your best to mitigate them is a whole lot better than surrender. Knowing the difference is the key.

And yes, I did procrastinate on writing this article. But I got some words down I first had the idea. I also reassured myself that I could just scrap the article if it turned out poorly. Plus, the article is set to publish automatically on January 22, so, right now, on afternoon on January 21st, I am writing and rewriting these words. I have other things to do, and that's ok, but I am definitely finishing this goddamn article.
