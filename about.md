Hi! I'm a first-year student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and (intended) Economics.

My passion is studying social problems through quantitative lens. In the past, I've researched applied economics, bioinformatics, and natural language processing. My current interests include strategy consulting, competitive debate, and economics research.

I use this site as a place to share new projects and personal updates. I ultimately hope to get comfortable with writing, especially in large quantities.

I'm currently looking for software engineering and data science roles for the summer of 2021. If you think you might have an opportunity, please [reach out](mailto:petez@berkeley.edu)!
