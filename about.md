Hi! I'm a first-year student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and (intended) Economics.

My passion is studying social problems through quantitative lens. In the past, I've researched applied economics, bioinformatics, and natural language processing. My current interests include strategy consulting, competitive debate, and data science.

I use this site as a portfolio, book club, and blog. My overaching goal is to get comfortable with writing regularly, so I appreciate your readership and feedback.

I'm currently looking for Fall 2021/Spring 2022 roles related to public policy, economics, and/or data science. If you think you might have an opportunity, please [reach out](mailto:petez@berkeley.edu)!
