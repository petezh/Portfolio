Here's the [paperback](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548) and [audiobook](https://www.audible.com/pd/On-Writing-Well-Audio-Collection-Audiobook/B002V8KQLC).

**Utility**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

A thoroughly practical book, Zinnser sections off his book by lesson. The medium conveniently lends itself to examples. Every technique is aptly demonstrated by a masterful author (and every mistake hilariously parodied). I learned everything from how to write better emails to how to write better blog posts. Again, a little bit for everyone.

**Writing**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Who am I to critique the teacher? Every paragraph is crafted carefully, with entertaining, clear, and smooth passages. Zinnser could have written the book without borrowing examples from others; the book is a masterpiece in nonfiction writing.

Notes
===

- Re-write. Revisit every paragraph; toil at the typewriter. Removing clutter, improving word choice, and clarifying the message is the essence of writing.
- Inject humanity and warmth into your writing to form a bond with the reader. Write as you speak. No "indeed" or "furthermore."
- Push the boundaries. Hell, jump over the wall! Good writers discover unconventional connections.
- Always prepare more material than you will ultimately use. Be willing to part with what you don't need.
- Business writing is particularly subject to glut. Words like "drive" should be met with a pink slip.
- Be precise. A unexpected verb or adjective will spark joy in the reader. Still working on it.
- Full circles are nice. End where you started. William Zinnser's *On Writing Well* is a gentle, entertaining guide to nonfiction writing.
