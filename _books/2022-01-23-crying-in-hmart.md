Michelle Zauner's *Crying in H-Mart* recounts the death of her mother. The narrative dances between a turbulent cross-cultural childhood, her mother's gradual loss to cancer, and the painful family fractures left in its wake.

**Utility**: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

Sometimes relatable, sometimes surreal, the book is first and foremost a personal history. I drew important lessons on the tensions between Asian and western cultures and the values that become clear only in light of mortality.

**Writing**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Zauner is great at bringing out the tears. She has a talent for building characters that feel human and present, characters that you'll care for. Which makes her story—tragic but true—all the more gripping. A generally pleasant experience.
