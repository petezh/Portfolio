Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for dropping by.

### Who Are You?

I'm a junior at UC Berkeley. I study computer science, economics, and [ORMS](http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/operations-research-management-science/).

### What's This?

This site is a portfolio, blog, and notebook. I set it up to practice turning thoughts into words. It's become a way for me to share my ideas with others. Here's some more about me:

- My [habits](habits) ðŸ¤”
- My [media diet](media) ðŸ“º
- My [ideas](ideas) ðŸ’¡

### What Do You Do?

I want to help us better understand ourselves. I hope to ask and answer questions about individuals and economies. I'm broadly interested in academic research, competitive debate, and data science.

On campus, I advise projects for [Voyager Consulting](http://www.voyagerconsulting.org/). I study applications of language models for social science under Ruiqi Zhong at [Berkeley NLP](http://nlp.cs.berkeley.edu/) and a variety of behavioral economics topics in the [Moore Accuracy Lab](https://learnmoore.org/). I direct tournaments for the [Debate Society of Berkeley](https://debate.berkeley.edu/) and I'm a member of [Traders at Berkeley](https://traders.berkeley.edu/). I offer advice through UPE and you can book my office hours [here](https://upe.berkeley.edu/profdev/services/).

Previously, I conducted research on [reproducibility](https://www.bitss.org/), [resilience dividends](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1260), [cancer bioinformatics](../publication/2021-08-27-tpwshiny), and [natural language processing](../publication/2020-10-01-edges). I'm a former debate coach at [Bronx Science](https://www.bxscience.edu/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=105230&type=d) and former brief writer at [Premier Debate](https://www.premierdebate.com/). I spent stints writing for the [Berkeley Economic Review](https://econreview.berkeley.edu/) and the [Daily Californian](https://www.dailycal.org/author/peterzhang/). I used to teach [CS 61A](https://cs61a.org/), Berkeley's introductory Python course, through [CSM](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/) and course staff.

Outside of school, I was trading intern at [SIG](https://sig.com/) this past summer and was a SWE intern at AWS the summer before.

### Can We Talk?

Yes! Have a question or criticism? A cool data science idea? Want advice (no quality guarantees)? Message me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/petejzh/) or shoot me an [email](petez@berkeley.edu).

### What Do You Look Like?
