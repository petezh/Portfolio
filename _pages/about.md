Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for dropping by.

### Who Are You?

I'm Peter. I study [computer science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), [economics](http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/economics/), and [ORMS](http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/operations-research-management-science/) at UC Berkeley with a minor in [public policy](http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/public-policy/).

### What's This?

This site is a portfolio, blog, and notebook. I set it up to practice turning thoughts into words. It's become a way for me to share my ideas with others. Here's some more about me:

- My [habits](habits) ðŸ¤”
- My [media diet](media) ðŸ“º
- My [ideas](ideas) ðŸ’¡

### What Do You Do?

My passion is building interesting, technical solutions to real-world problems. I am broadly interested in academic research, software development, strategy consulting, competitive debate, and data science. Previously, I conducted research on [reproducibility](https://www.bitss.org/), [resilience dividends](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1260), [cancer bioinformatics](../publication/2021-08-27-tpwshiny), and [natural language processing](../publication/2020-10-01-edges). I'm a former debate coach at [Bronx Science](https://www.bxscience.edu/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=105230&type=d) and brief writer at [Premier Debate](https://www.premierdebate.com/).

On campus, I'm a consultant, account manager, and senior advisor for [Voyager Consulting](http://www.voyagerconsulting.org/). I study computational news slant under Ruiqi Zhong at [Berkeley NLP](http://nlp.cs.berkeley.edu/) and a variety of behavioral finance topics under [Prof. Ulrike Malmendier](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~ulrike/). I direct tournaments for the [Debate Society of Berkeley](https://debate.berkeley.edu/) and teach [CS 61A](https://cs61a.org/) through [CSM](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/) and course staff. Previously, I wrote for the [Berkeley Economic Review](https://econreview.berkeley.edu/) and the [Daily Californian](https://www.dailycal.org/author/peterzhang/).

### Can We Talk?
