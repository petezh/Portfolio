Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for dropping by.

I'm Peter. I study [computer science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), [economics](http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/economics/), and [ORMS](http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/operations-research-management-science/) at UC Berkeley with a minor in [public policy](http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/public-policy/). My passion is building interesting, technical solutions to real-world problems. I am broadly interested in academic research, software development, strategy consulting, competitive debate, and data science.

Previously, I conducted research on [reproducibility](https://www.bitss.org/), [resilience dividends](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1260), [cancer bioinformatics](../publication/2021-08-27-tpwshiny), and [natural language processing](../publication/2020-10-01-edges). I'm a former debate coach at [Bronx Science](https://www.bxscience.edu/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=105230&type=d) and brief writer at [Premier Debate](https://www.premierdebate.com/).

On campus, I'm a consultant, account manager, and senior advisor for [Voyager Consulting](http://www.voyagerconsulting.org/). I direct tournaments for the [Debate Society of Berkeley](https://debate.berkeley.edu/) and teach [CS 61A](https://cs61a.org/) through [CSM](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/) and course staff. Previously, I wrote for the [Berkeley Economic Review](https://econreview.berkeley.edu/) and the [Daily Californian](https://www.dailycal.org/author/peterzhang/).


This site is a portfolio, blog, and notebook. It's primarily intended to help me practice expressing my ideas. It's also a way for me to document the [books I read](tags/#book-review), track my [media diet](media), and store my [ideas](ideas). Have a question or criticism? A cool data science idea?
