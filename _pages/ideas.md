## Finishing Weak üîö
Whenever I write a review, the last fourth is always the hardest. I'm almost there, and I already have a lot of good content. Why not slack a little on notes for the last chapter? [Ego depletion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/ego-depletion) suggests that willpower is a limited resource that decays over time. It's been studied extensively in lab tasks, with mixed conclusions. But what about similar tasks in the real world with a defined "endpoint?" Do book summaries get more sparse as the chapters go on? Do people document code less as they wrap up a project? Can we quantify when and how much people "slack" as they reach the finish line?s

## Chess Dataset ‚ôüÔ∏è
It must be an [underused dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess). Performance in chess games can tell us a host of things about persistance, general intelligence, and executive control. For example, how many lost games until someone gives up for the day? Is the hot hand a *thing* in chess? Did the general public get better or worse at chess after COVID-19 hit? What about after daylight savings?

## Debater Careers üëî
What exactly do high school debaters do post-graduation? Does *how* they debated inform their career trajectories? Take one or more year's worth of TOC entries. Segment them by debate type (PF/LD/Policy) and style (philosophy, policy, critical, tricks, flex). Use LinkedIn to identify their college major and internship/full-time industry. If the K debaters have it right, then LARPers/PFers should work more in finance/consulting etc. We can compile a table and make a [Sankey diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram).

## Market (Over?)sizing üß∫
We know that investors are [overconfident](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.29.4.61), and we know how much is lost due to excessive trading. What about market researchers, who are one step away? One type of study they do is market sizing: estimating, among other things, the total available market (TAM) for a given good or service. We might expect them to be too bullish, betting that a market is bigger than it really is. But validating such an estimate is harder - many times, the TAM is never realized. Here's how we could empirically test for overconfidence: Take an industry like education. Segment it by different features - by grade level, online vs. hybrid, public vs. private, etc. Look for estimates of both *overall* TAM and TAM for each segment. Compare these two when added up. As [Don Moore](../books/perfectly-confident) might suggest, people who zero-in on their specific case and don't take the outside view may end up being biased.

## Bikeshare Surge Pricing üö≤
Ride share programs are well-known for using surge pricing to adjust demand and supply across time. Bike sharing apps like Lyft should do the same, except based on location instead of time. When I try to bike around campus, there's an annoying imbalanced of bikes. On the west of campus, there's an abundance of bikes. On the east side, empty docks abound. The reason? The campus *slopes down* from east to west, so one way is a speedy, smooth glide, while the other is a pain in the ass. Lyft should price based off of location and altitude so that there's bikes at Haas that I use to fly home.

## Bookmark Archive üîñ
Several people I know, myself included, make a folder on Chrome's bookmarks bar called "Archive." Whenever I stop using a set of bookmarks (say, for a short-term project), I stash it away in the archive folder. But this gets pretty annoying. You have to search an unordered dropdown and carefully hover over subfolders. There are currently ways to [export and import bookmarks](https://www.hellotech.com/guide/for/how-to-export-save-import-bookmarks-in-chrome). Why not add a dedicated bookmark archive that let's people easily organize and find old bookmarks?

## Urban Dictionary Names üìõ
The Urban Dictionary name [trend](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/11/23/urban-dictionary-search-name-trend/8731931002/) has taken over my Instagram. I noticed an interesting pattern: while most names have flattering definitions some names have neutral/negative descrptions. Moreover, it seems that more popular names (like [Lauren](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Lauren)) have more positive defitions than less popular names (like [Xaviere](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Xaviere)). I suspect that it's because the page for a name like Lauren will get more visits from people *named* Lauren, who drive up upvotes for positive definitions. We could use this [database](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/TYJKEZ/MPMHFE&version=1.3) of first names find relationships between name popularity (and racial demographics) and the sentiment of the Urban Dictionary definition.

## Debater Overconfidence ü§≠
The [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://www.britannica.com/science/Dunning-Kruger-effect) predicts that people with the least skill will be the most overconfident. Is this true of debaters? At debate tournaments, I'll often hear both sides walk away thinking that they've "definitely picked up." It happens especially often in mid- or lower-level debates. An experiment could survey debaters right after their rounds, asking them to estimate their chance of winning. We could also test the effect of a monetary incentive: if $5 is on the line, do they become more accurate? If they do, is there an implied "price of self-image"?

## Zipcars and Speeding üèéÔ∏è
Zipcar operates on a [reservation system](https://support.zipcar.com/hc/en-us/articles/220676227-Reservation-Timeframes), which means drivers have to book a time frame in advance. One night, I could only book 90 minutes for a trip to Oakland. What would've been a smooth trip became rushed after I had to stop to recharge my phone. I ended up heading back with only 20 minutes left. Although I knew better than to speed, I probably subtly went a little faster than I normally would. Are there more accidents and traffic violations towards the end of a reservation? Let's get in contact with Zipcar and offer to do the analysis for them!

## Chipotle's Cup Fee ü•§
I fill my water cup with soda. Chipotle [doesn't like it](https://hard-money.net/chipotle-up-after-hiring-security-to-ensure-people-dont-fill-water-cups-with-soda/). Yet, they recently decided to start charging ¬¢25 for water cups. But, as explored in the [first chapter](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/books/chapters/freakonomics.html) in Freakonomics, fees can often serve as moral license, crowding out intrinsic motivations. For those who didn't steal soda on principle, the fee may empower them to abandon their moral riteousness. Since Chipotle supposedly studies soda-stealing, this is a question we could answer.

## Scoots and Steps üõµ
I used to be an adventurous one. I walked 10,000+ steps every day to get around Berkeley. Ever since I got my scooter, my daily steps have plummetted to somewhere around 2,000-3,000 steps. The Mayo Clinic recommends [10,000](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/10000-steps/art-20317391) steps a day for healthy adults, so the substitution may actually have tangible health impacts. With nearly everyone keeping track of their own daily steps, could we gather data points from new scooter owners to measure the decrease in walking associated with buying a scooter?
