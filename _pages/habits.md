## Goal Setting üéØ
- List daily, weekly, and semesterly goals by context (e.g. recruiting, classes, health, etc.). Good goals are realistic and measureable.
- Set aside time every day to identify goals. It can coincide with shower time or walking to class. Spend time each week reflecting on progress towards goals and time allocation.
- Use a simple notetaking app like [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) or a dedicated app like [Todolist](https://todoist.com/) ot manage and track your goals.
- [Sharpen the saw](https://www.franklincovey.com/habit-7/). Don't let achieving immediate goals blind you from growing and exploring new things.

## Health and Wealth üèÉüí∞
- Use a budgeting app integrated with bank accounts to automatically track expenses and assist with setting goals. [Mint](https://mint.intuit.com/) and [You Need a Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) are great apps.
- Put your savings in a index fund like Vanguard's [S&P 500 index](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VOO).
- Meditate for 5 minutes every morning. Apps like [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) or [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) are nice, but a quick [search](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=meditation) for "meditation" on Youtube is just as good.
- Get 8 hours of good sleep, every night. No [blue lighting](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side) three hours before bed. Turn on night mode on all devices. Consider reading before bed.
- Jog or workout every day. Make physical exercise non-optional, just like eating or sleeping.

## Time ‚åõ
- Use time blocking wtih [Google Calendar](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/time-blocking), marking off 30 minute+ periods to focus on a specific task.
- Multitask when the focus tradeoff is minimal. Some ideas: e.g. work on homework during class, listen to podcasts while traveling, brainstorming in the shower, etc.
- Purchase a [GOTRAX XR Elite scooter](https://gotrax.com/products/xr-elite-commuting-electric-scooter) if you are spending more than 30 minutes in non-productive commutes.

## Attention üëÄ
- If you're working, intend on completing one task at a time. The mental [cost of switching](https://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask) between tasks usually outweighs efficiency benefits.
- Set your phone to Do Not Disturb (and/or use apps like [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/)). Block sites with extensions (ike [Strict Workflow](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/strict-workflow/cgmnfnmlficgeijcalkgnnkigkefkbhd?hl=en)) or more hardcore apps (like [SelfRestraint](https://alternativeto.net/software/selfrestraint/about/) for Windows and [SelfControl](http://selfcontrolapp.com/) for MacOS).

## Tasks ‚òëÔ∏è
- Assignments are due when they are assigned. Before reaching for YouTube, think about how stressful it is to rush a last minute paper or problem set. Work done now is fun earned later. Set a task when the assingment is due, and a reminder when the assignment is released.
- For larger projects, segment tasks into smaller pieces that can be completed in a work session.
- Alternate contexts to avoid burnout. Instead of doing three C.S. problem sets in a row, mix in some econ homework, recruiting, or consulting work.

## Inbox üì•
- Take advantage of extensions. Use [Streak](https://www.streak.com/) for email tracking/schedule sending, [ClearBit]9https://clearbit.com/) to find contacts, [Checker Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/checker-plus-for-gmail/oeopbcgkkoapgobdbedcemjljbihmemj?hl=en) for one-click access to your inbox, 
- Use labels and filters to set up [multiple inboxes](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-your-gmail-better-with-multiple-inboxes/). Before wading through emails, use keyboard shortcuts to perform a speedy "first pass" and categorize truly important emails.
- Unsubscribe from and/or filter useless emails. When signing up for promotions, use a burner/spam email. Create filters to send Piazza notifications straight to ~~hell~~ the archive.
- If you often reuse the same template (e.g. for scheduling meetings), use Gmail's built in email templates or an extension like [Briskine](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/briskine-email-templates/lmcngpkjkplipamgflhioabnhnopeabf).

## Happiness üòä
- Customize the [Daylio](https://daylio.net/) app to track desired habits. Especially consider adding social and personal goals. Log habits daily.
- Practice gratefulness. Whether through an app or notebook, write 3 good fortunes each day. Consider building gratefulness into a meditation routine.
- Socialize. Relationship quality is the [strongest predictor](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/want_to_be_happy_make_your_relationships_exceptional) of long-term happiness. 

## Organization üßπ
- Put things back right after using them, parallelizing when possible. An exception is bulk processing - wash the dishes all at once after dinner.
- Schedule chores like laundry, cleaning, taking out the trash, etc. instead of waiting for a crisis.
- Physically section off living space. Have a place to work, a place to sleep, a place to eat, etc. Don't touch that fucking laptop in bed.

## Learning üìö
- For classes, write minimalistic notes (in an app like [Typora](https://typora.io/) or [Bear](https://bear.app/)) and complete homework in [Latex](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes). Store files in a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository synced across devices.
- To memorize facts, use the [Anki flashcard software](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and download cards for any topic: geography, languages, etc.
- Read, god dammit. Pick up a book at the library or buy one off Amazon. [*Misbehaving*](https://www.amazon.com/Misbehaving-Behavioral-Economics-Richard-Thaler/dp/039335279X) by Richard Thaler is a good place to start.
- Put those ears to work. Spend time finding interesting podcasts or e-books to listen to while traveling, exercizing, cooking, etc. Consider keeping track of a [media diet](media).
