In the summer of 2020, I supported the development of the [EDGe$ software](https://edges.nist.gov/) under [Dr. Jennifer Helgeson](https://www.nist.gov/people/jennifer-f-helgeson) at NIST's Applied Economics Office. The software gives policymakers an intuitive framework for making investments in resiliency projects.

Suppose you are a local authority in a coastal town that regularly floods. Following a particularly severe flood, you decide that an investment in flood infrastructure is necessary. But what will you build? More storm drains and pipes? Or vegetated roofs and roadside plantings?

In addition to effectiveness at mitigating a disaster, resilience investments impose externalities and [co-benefits](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/TechnicalNotes/NIST.TN.1959.pdf). A new park can be both a pleasant communal space and a buffer for floodwater. EDGe$ encourages decisions to explicitly factor in all costs and benefits. I worked with Dr. Helgeson to conduct a literature review on co-benefits in resiliency planning and publish a [tutorial](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1260.pdf) on EDGe$ with a case study inspired by the [Ronald Reagan Presidential Library](https://www.reaganfoundation.org/).

Since this paper, Helgeson and her team have published another [case study](http://www.umsl.edu/econ/files/pdfs/pandemic_planning_2020.pdf) and further [research](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13084554) on resilience dividends.
