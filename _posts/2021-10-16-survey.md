Hello! This survey is for a project my friend is working on centered around Apple’s current repair service offerings. If you are an Apple user, she’d really appreciate it if you could take 5-7 minutes of your time to fill out this survey which presents to you a selection of questions surrounding your iPhone/iPad device repair experience: [https://berkeley.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bObXQMou6AKP0QS](https://berkeley.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bObXQMou6AKP0QS?fbclid=IwAR2Cfg432WCh9-zkZCeV5JK5QNWQAsUU3KdTVLBT7N1otnHGAHmJQnAx8z8) She will be randomly selecting two respondents to be rewarded with a $50 Amazon gift card in two weeks. This is part of an exploratory study and please be assured that results will be anonymised and will never be released publicly. Thank you for your time, and stay safe everyone!
