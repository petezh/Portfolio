### Review

<img align="right" width="30%" src="/resources/books/food_rules.jpg">

Michael Pollan's *Food Rules* is a pocket-sized manual on effective eating.

Here's the [paperback](https://amzn.to/3rFpsxn) and [audiobook](https://amzn.to/3l84xlh).

Utility: ★★★★✰ (4/5)

Writing: ★★★★✰ (4/5)

Quite a useful guide that confirms a lot of what my mother says. Certainly worth the time investment!

### Notes

1. The Western diet is the root of our poor health, and it manifests as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Traditional diets the world over, some high-fat, some high-carbs, all manage to do better.
2. Avoid processed foods, particularly ones that rely on sugar and advertising.
3. Eat a variety of plants. Eat meat sparingly (only grass-fed (except fish!)).
4. Vitamin supplements don't help.
5. Enjoy naturally caffeinated drinks.
6. Enjoy a glass of wine with dinner.
7. Eat less - eat slowly from a smaller plate with others around you.
