I have a poor record with New Year's resolutions. I trust that nailing them to this site will keep me accountable (or at very least, punish my failure with shame).

#### 2021 Resolutions

1. Put half my income each month in a savings account.
2. Find a meaningful summer internship; recruit early for the fall.
3. Blog twice a month about my readings, projects, and thoughts.
4. Read three books each month, exploring new subjects.
5. Spend more time with family before college.
6. Practice gratitude in my morning meditations.
7. Stop biting my goddamn nails.
8. Sleep on a consistent schedule, deviating at most once a week.
9. Learn to sing harmony.
10. Abandon Coke.

Wish me luck.
