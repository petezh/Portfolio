Starting December of 2021, I had the fortune of working with [Ruiqi Zhong](https://ruiqi-zhong.github.io/) on problems in NLP related to scalable insightsâ€”using language models to help discover a ground truth where humans cannot.

I originally contributed to a project related to slant in news articles, where slant is defined by retweets from congresspeople. I fine-tuned various langauge models to better predict slant in each article.

Since May of 2022, I've worked on extending an [existing research project](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12323) about describing the differences between two distributions of text. Some contributions I have made include:
- Compiling an original [benchmark](https://github.com/petezh/Describe-Differences-Benchmark/) of 50 interdisciplinary datasets, which has been presented to positive reception at conferences.
- Implementing multiple improvements to increase the computational efficiency of the system and improve the quality of the insights.
