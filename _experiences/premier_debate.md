During high school, I was heavily involved in competitive debate and especially enjoyed the research component. For three school years, I worked as an editor and, later, product mananger at [Premier Debate](https://www.premierdebate.com/), a debate education institution.

I wrote a total of 42 topic [briefings](https://www.premierdebate.com/briefs/) for Lincoln-Douglas and Public Forum debate topics for the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, and 2020-2021 debate seasons. Each brief was comprised of 50-250 pieces of high-quality evidence: excerpts from academic sources with full citations and underlining. These briefs were used by tens of thousands of debaters over the years.

I also designed and maintained the Premier Debate website, including its [online shop](https://www.premierdebate.com/shop), managing 150,000+ visitors since 2019, working with WordPress plugins and custom CSS.
