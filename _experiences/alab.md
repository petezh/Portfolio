In fall of 2022, I joined the [Accuracy Lab](https://learnmoore.org/) under Professor Don Moore, where I contribute to several current projects and am leading a new project measuring the calibration of langauge models. I work with [Sandy Campbell](https://www.sandycampbell.me/) to assess the effect of survey design and incentive on participant accuracy and calibration.
