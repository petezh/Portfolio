During the 2020-2021 school year, I coached the varsity Lincoln-Douglas debate team at the [Bronx High School of Science](https://www.bxscience.edu/apps/pages/index.jsp), which has the top ranked [speech and debate team](https://www.bxscience.edu/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=105230&type=d) in the country. I had the pleasure of working with 28 talented sophomores, juniors, and seniors to develop their critical thinking, speaking, and research skills. My responsibilities included:
- Preparing materials and introductions to bimonthly debate topics, including hundreds of pages of evidence.
- Leading and designing semiweekly practice sessions, along with office hours throughout the week, totaling 5+ hours of weekly  instruction.
- Judged 200+ rounds at 18 national tournaments, during which I provided strategic and topical advice to attending debaters.

Ultimately, we qualified multiple debaters to the national championship, the [Tournament of Champions](https://www.tabroom.com/index/tourn/index.mhtml?tourn_id=16714).
