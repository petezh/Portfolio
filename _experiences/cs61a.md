I was a tutor during the [Summer 2021](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su21/) and [fall 2021](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa21/) sessions of CS 61A. Over the summer, I taught two sections of 6 students twice a week for 8 weeks; over the fall, I taught a section of 8 students once a week for 13 weeks. I prepared 12 [slide decks](files/cs61a_su21_tutorials.zip) for teaching topics, including data structures, object oriented programming, functional programming, regex, SQL, and more. Combined, I resolved over **100 total office hours** tickets and taught over **40 sections**.

Additionally, I assisted Pamela Fox each week with live lectures, answering questions in real time from 1,000 students. And, through Computer Science Mentors, I led the 61A content team to prepare 13 weekly worksheets for about 100 tutors.
