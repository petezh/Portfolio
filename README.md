## Peter's Portfolio

I reconfigured `academicpages`, a Github Pages template for academic websites and a fork of the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). For usage, see https://academicpages.github.io/.

Some modifications I made:
- Changed collections to `books`, `projects`, `experience`, `publications`, `writings`, and `notes`.
- Modified CV to generate directly from `projects`, `experience`, and `publications`.
- Created rating system for books.
- Added some personal pages.
