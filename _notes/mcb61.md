Midterm
===

### Chapter 1
**Chauvet Cave**: cave in Southern France with drawings from Paleolithic humans deep in the cavern; darkness of cave enabled inner exploration
**Shamans**: healers "skilled in accessing states of mind that are sources of knowledge and power, which may then be used in the service of others in the community"
opening scenes of Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey: one group of hominins (protohumans, including ardipithecus, australopithecus, and homo) discovers bones as weapons
HAL: AI aboard spaceship, open question about whether it counts as "concious"
size of brain rapidly expanded in last 2 mm years, with more sophisticated behaviors
**mind**: the collection of mental experiences, or our subjective (first-person, internal) experiences, including our thoughts, feelings, perceptions (visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile), mental images, and sense of self.
**consciousness**: the capacity to be aware; closely related but not the same, e.g. in a dream or Freudian unconcious
**mind-body problem:** what is the relationship between our mental experience and the physiology of our body and brain?

### Chapter 2
**William James**: "pioneer in the modern scientific study of mind," found that damage to brain impairs senses
The nervous system is a network within the body that functions to manipulate external and internal information.
**Neurons** are involved in the signal transduction in the nervous system whereas **neuroglia** are the supporting cells of the neurons
Hydra and worms have basic nueral networks, insects more complex
Vertibrates all have forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain regions; cerebrum is larger in the evolutionarily recent birds and mammals
Mammalian cerebrum has bumps (**gyri**) and grooves (**sulci**)
Four lobes of the cerebral cortex: frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal.
**Corpus callosum**: a bundle of approximately 200 million nerve fibers connecting the right and left cerebral hemispheres
**Andreas Vesalius**: Italian physician who carefully disected bodies, producing illustrations
**meninges**: comprised of, from outside to inner, dura mater, arachnoid, and pia mater; cerebrospinal fluid (**CSF**) rests between arachnoid and pia layers; **meningitis** is an infection of this area
**Descartes** thought signaling might happen via fluid pressure
**Luigi Galvani**: Italian physician, found evidence that electricity drives signaling by animating legs of dead frogs; work carried on by other physicians, helped by rigorous theories of electricity
**Camillo Golgi**: developed technique for brain staining involving potassium dichromate, silver nitrate, and silver chromate
Santiago Ramon y Cajal worked with Golgi to show that brains were densely packed with nuerons and glias

### Chapter 3
**chemistry**: the scientific endeavor concerned with the nature of matter and its transformations; "chemistry investigates the conditions of how these elemental constituents (atoms) interact to form larger entities called molecules"
**alchemy** was also concerned with the nature and transformation of matter (e.g. Boyle/Newton sought Philosopher's Stone), but by Lavoisier and Priestley, it mostly transitioned
**Dmitri Mendeleev** organized chemitcal elements into periodic table
elements of humans by weight:
oxygen ~ 65%
carbon ~ 18.5%
hydrogen ~ 9.5%
nitrogen ~ 3.2%
calcium ~ 1.5%
phosphorus ~ 1.0%
potassium ~ 0.4%
sulfur ~ 0.3%
sodium ~ 0.2%
chlorine ~ 0.2% 
without water, carbon dominates
**ions** have net positive (cations) or negative charge (anions)
**covalent chemical bonds**: "sharing of electrons between atoms"
**organic molecules** contain mostly carbon (which defines the structure) and hydrogen (most numerous); molecules with *only* carbon and hydrogen are **hydrocarbons** (e.g. methane, petroleum, ethylene)
rules for diagrams: covalent bonds = lines, carbon and hydrogen are implicit, 
**polarity**: separation of charge between different parts of the molecule, e.g. in water
in hydrogen bonds, "the slightly negative oxygen atom of one water molecule is attracted to the slightly positive hydrogen atom of another"
hydrophobic / lipophilic = avoids water, drawn to lipids; hydrophilic / lipophobic; avoids lipids, drawn to water
lipids / fats, **phospholipids**: medium-size molecules composed primarily of carbon and hydrogen atoms in long chains, generally sixteen to twenty-four carbon atoms long
a **fatty acid** is a hydrocarbon chain with a carboxylic acid group attached
**phospholipid bilayer membrane**: "the hydrophilic head groups form the exterior surfaces (in contact with one another and in contact with the water environment), and the hydrophobic tail groups are inside the layers (in contact with one another and shielded from contact with the water environment by the hydrophilic heads)"
**quaternary amine**: "positive charge comes from an electron deficit arising from the nitrogen having four bonds with other atoms, rather than its customary three"
**amino acids**: "a molecule that contains both an amine group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH)"; amino
acids can join together with peptide bonds to form a chain of amino acids called a **polypeptide**
**proteins**: "large molecules built from amino acids linked into long chains by covalent chemical bonds, called peptide bonds."
levels of description for protein structure: primary (list of amino acids forming the protein), secondary (interactions to produce local folding, e.g. alpha helix), tertiary (overall shape), quaternary (multiple polypeptide subunit,)
**carbohydrates**: enormous molecules, such as glycogen, starches, and cellulose, storing lots of energy
**nucleic acids**: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA); composed of chains of nucleotides, denine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T)

### Chapter 4
**Charles Darwin**: proposed theory of evolution, including variation in attributes and natural selection
**Gregor Mendel**: experimented with plants, showed that characteristics are stored in genes
gene: fundamental unit of heriditary information
Niels Bohr suggested that studying genes/living organisms could fundamentally disrupt the cell, corrupting results
**Max Delbrück** hypothesized that genes are stored in large molecules, mutated by x-rays, towards which Erwin Schrödinger drew attention; he later studied bactiophages, which were composed of DNA and RNA
Oswald Avery first demonstrated that DNA can carry information, not protein, but it wasn't widely accepted until the Hershey-Chase experiment, which used radioactive markers
Francis Crick and James Watson proposed the double-helical structure of DNA: "adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C),joined by covalent bonds to a very long backbone of sugar molecules (deoxyribose) and phosphates (phosphorus-oxygen groups)."
triplets of necleoties, or codons, corresponding to amino acids, of which there are only 20, so there is duplication
DNA is converted to RNA by substituting G-C, C-G, T-A, A-U (**transcription**); then carried by mRNA to ribosomes to synthesize proteins (**translation**)

### Chapter 5
Electricity = movement of charge
major ions for neural function: Na+, K+, Cl-, Ca++
**diffusion**: thermal agitation produces random movements that distribute particles uniformly, e.g. milk in tea
ion channels: proteins embedded in cell membrane that allow certain ions
ion pumps: proteins that use energy to move ions, e.g. Na/K pump (moves Na+ out, brings K+ in)
ATP: adenine and a ribose sugar, storing substantial energy
energy consumption by human brain is 25 percent of the total basal consumption, or about 360 kilocalories per day
ion concentration differences inside and outside a neuron result in electric charge differences
membrane potential and resting potential:voltage across the nerve cell membrane, measured by placing one electrode from a voltmeter inside the cell and a second voltmeter electrode outside the cell
**hyperpolarization**: creation of a greater separation of charge across a cell membrane, e.g. opening K+ or Cl- channels
**depolarization**: positive voltage enters the neuron, decreased separation of chage, e.g. Na+ or Ca++ entering
Alan Hodgkin, Andrew Huxley directly measured action potential
**action potential**: a depolarization large enough to reach about -50 mV causes the membrane potential to rapidly become positive, peaking at +30mV
**voltage-gated ion channels**: closed when the membrane potential is at rest and opens at some voltage, e.g. -50mV for Na+ and +30mV for K+
action potential **propagation** along axon/soma: local depolarization triggers the voltage-gated channels in the adjacent axonal region to open
**axon hillock**: the region where the axon emerges from the soma of the cell, where voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels occur in high density.
refractory period: "after the voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels are triggered to open and close, they require several milliseconds to return to a state that can be triggered again to open."
myelin: layers of lipid bilayer membrane, covers many nerve cell axons, contributes to structural integrity and fluidity
oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells: myelinating cells of the central nervous system
nodes of Ranvier: gaps along the axon with high conceptrations of ion channels
saltatory conduction: action potential leaps from one node to the next, incoming potnetials rapidly jump across nodes


### Chapter 6

**chemical synapse**: more complex and provides opportunities for additional kinds of regulation, such as changes in strength, feedback, and varied effects on different target cells; a.k.a. "synapse", without qualification
SNARE complex is comprised of **synaptic vesicle**, small spheres formed of lipid bilayer membrane, filled with several thousand neurotransmitter molecules, and **synaptic cleft**, which separates presynaptic axon terminal and the postsynaptic cell
neurotransmitter receptor: located in the cell membranes of postsynaptic neurons, recieves transmittors like a key and lock
reuptake transporter: proteins that move nuerotransmitters from the exterior of the cell back into the interior, and so out of the synaptic cleft
dendritic spine: a bulge on a dendrite that increases the surface area available for receiving signalss
Otto Loewi: proved existence of neurotransmitters by stimulating frog hearts and transplanting fluids
Vagusstoff (also acetylcholine, the first molecule recognized as a neurotransmitter) was found to mediate signal from vagus nerve to the heart
glutamate: most abundant neurotransmitter molecule, also a building-block amino acid
**GABA**: gamma-amino-butyric acid, major inhibitory neurotransmitter
glutamic acid decarboxylase
ionotropic receptor: spans the cell membrane, has donut like hole, composed of four or five protein subunits, closed and opens with nuerotramitter binds to a site, a.k.a. ligand-gated channel receptor,
EPSP: excitatory postsynaptic potential
IPSP: inhibitory postsynaptic potential, commonly by way of GABA
spatial and temporal summation of neuronal input
metabotropic receptor: affect chemistry inside the cell, e.g. ion channels may open or close, enzymes may be activated or inactivated, gene transcription may be turned on or off, and so forth
GPCR (G-protein-coupled receptors) signaling: molecule of GDP (guanosine diphosphate) attached to the G-protein comes off and is replaced with a molecule of GTP (guanosine triphosphate, a chemical relative of ATP), pieces of G-protein then move around on the inner surface of the cell membrane and bind to other things
G-protein pieces can bind with adenylate cyclase. catalized cAMP, which can activate **protein kinase**, among other proteins
cAMP, cGMP, IP3 and DAG are sometimes called intracellular messengers or second messengers

### Chapter 7

Most receptors are GPCrs, there's ionotropic receptors to serotonin (5HT3) and ATP/ADP/AMP (purine receptors)
**seizure**:
- could be manifestation of runaway excitation, resulting in changes in sensory perception, emotional/cognitive changes, involuntary movement
- most seizures are idiopathic, meaning that they is no known cause, constitutes 1 percent of the US population
**epilepsy**: clinical condition of recurring seizures
**antiseizure medications**: reduces the amount of excitation, or enhances the amount of inhibition, via interference with voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and calcium channels; facilitation of the inhibitory action of GABA; and reduction of the excitatory action of glutamate.
