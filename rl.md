## Software

First, download and install the following software.

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - free, easy-to-use Python IDE. Used for writing Python programs.

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) - tool for creating Python notebooks, with sharable visualizations and explanations.

## Minimax

Minimax is an algorithm used to calculate the best move in a game. Check out [this article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-1-introduction/) to learn about the minimax algorithm. Or check out the video below.

## Alpha-Beta

Go [here](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/developers/minimax-algorithm-alpha-beta-pruning/) to learn about alpha-beta pruning and check out [this website](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa14/ta-materials/apps/ab_tree_practice/) for some practice.

## Monte-Carlo

Read [this introduction](https://int8.io/monte-carlo-tree-search-beginners-guide/) to Monte Carlo search tries, and make sure you can parse through [this implementation](http://mcts.ai/code/python.html).
